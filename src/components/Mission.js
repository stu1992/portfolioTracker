          Most of my friends suck with money and it's so easy to invest. I don't want to retire at the age of 40 and have no one to invite on weekend adventures, because all my mates are busy working.

          I see 2 common solutions for wealth aggregation. The first solution is an uphill battle against bureaucracy and paperwork creating a barrier for entry.

          It's my mission to offer investment advice to people I trust without it costing anything.
